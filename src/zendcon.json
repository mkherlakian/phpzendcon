Will you be starting with a few endpoints, or many? Or gradually growing your API? Expressive is a middleware microframework that is incredibly suited to building APIs \u2014 particularly because we also provide packages for each of these API responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will demonstrate buidling a REST API using Expressive. It will provide representations using Hypermedia Application Language, error handling in Problem Details for HTTP APIs format, authentication using OAuth2, and demonstrate common concerns such as data validation and authorization.",

Z-Ray provides PHP application developers with fine-grained insights about page requests, warnings and errors, events, and database queries. It can be integrated into Zend Server or used standalone for efficient debugging. But until now, Z-Ray does not track the data flow for security-related issues. In this talk, we present our integration of automated security analysis into Z-Ray.\r\n\r\nWe use the deep insights provided by Z-Ray to greatly speed-up and simplify a static code analysis process. Due to the reduced analysis time, it can be used during development and testing of single components without the need to analyze the complete code base. At the same time, detected security bugs can be easily verified with one click by combining the collected information about the web requests and the results of a context-sensitive security analysis. We will cover technical insights about how Z-Ray can be extended, basics about static code analysis, and how both technologies can be combined to a new plugin that allows on-the-fly bug detection and verification.",

This provides users the ability to spin up a plethora of AMIs for specific purposes. To ensure repeatable, reliable and stable results, the Docker framework is used to create \u201ccanned\u201d operating systems that contain all the required dependencies within these AMIs.\r\n\r\nThe Docker images are run on AMIs and provide a renewed clean environment every time.\r\n\r\nUsing this combination of technologies, users can create powerful frameworks that complete complex tasks in a timely and reliable matter. Furthermore, the use of Docker enables developers and testers to quickly replicate build and test failures in the exact environment they occurred in without taking resources away from automation frameworks and without interfering with any currently running frameworks.\r\n\r\nCome to this track to find out the secret sauce and recipes on how to make this all happen.",

        "talk_description": "Artificial Intelligence is taking the world by storm, fueled largely by the introduction of the elastic compute resources in public cloud. If you\u2019ve recently shopped online, searched the web, or streamed a video, you\u2019ve almost certainly interacted with systems powered by AI. These systems are built on powerful Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, that until recently, required large time and financial commitments, as well as specialized knowledge and experience to properly develop, train and test. This is not so any more \u2014 the power of cloud computing has brought ML to the masses. Every developer now has the ability to leverage powerful ML resources of the cloud and bring the benefits of AI to their customers and users.\r\n\r\nBut \u2026 where do you start? What services can you use? What services should you use? How do you integrate those services into you application?\r\n\r\nDuring this session we\u2019ll answer those questions, and more, while building an AI-enabled PHP application. We\u2019ll review ML, introducing common concepts, terms and language. Then, we\u2019ll look at what ML services AWS provides and talk about which of those services is the right match for your application and for your team & skill set. Finally, we\u2019ll walk through a real-world design and demo the resulting PHP application. You\u2019ll walk away from this session with the confidence and knowledge necessary to make the right choices for your own application.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to be an AI\/ML expert to attend this session, nor do you need AWS experience. We\u2019ll keep that at a fairly high level. But we will be walking through PHP code examples, so some familiarity with the language would be beneficial.",

Because in the long run, we have found, as is true for most things, that the best way to not have problems with a product is to understand how it works.",
